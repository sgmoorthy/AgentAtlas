## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom design system
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **Vite** for fast development and building

### Data Layer
- **GitHub REST API** integration for real-time data
- Smart caching system to respect rate limits
- Multiple search strategies for comprehensive coverage
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Search Strategy
The application uses multiple search queries to discover AI agent projects:
- "ai agent"
- "ai assistant" 
- "autonomous agent"
- "llm agent"
- "chatbot framework"
- "conversational ai"
- "ai workflow"
- "agent framework"
- "multi-agent system"
- "intelligent agent"

### Auto-Update System
- Calculates next update time (daily at midnight UTC)
- Visual countdown timer showing time until next update
- Background refresh without user intervention
- Manual refresh capability for immediate updates
